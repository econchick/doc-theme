PyLadies Logo Usage
===================

PyLadies and the PyLadies logo are trademarks of the Python Software Foundation.  The full trademark usage policy can be read here: :doc:`trademark`.

In general, we want the logo to be used as widely as possible to indicate the support of or involvement with PyLadies. If you are a local PyLadies leader, you are free to adapt the logo to your location.  However, non-leaders, please `ask`_ first when using a derived version of the logo or when in doubt.


The PyLadies Logo
-----------------

The standard PyLadies wordmark logo (cursive writing) can be found in the ``wordmark`` directory of our `pyladies-assets`_ repository.  Use in combination with the PyLadies Geek logo (described below) is permitted. You may alter the colors of the wordmark but not the size or proportions.

T-Shirts & Other Merchandise
----------------------------

PyLadies T-Shirts and other merchandise featuring the Python logo can be purchased at Cafepress (sales benefit the PyLadies organization). Making your own shirts is OK too, but please seek permission from the `PyLadies leadership <ask>`_ if you are planning to sell merchandise that shows the PyLadies logo.


Derivitive Work
---------------

If you are a local PyLadies leader, you are free to adapt the logo to your location.  Some examples are below, and more can be found on our `locations`_ page.
