Global PyLadies Community
=========================

About
-----

The global PyLadies community has no formal organization behind it; no board of directors, no appointed leadership.  We found that PyLadies growth and success stems from being decentralized and non-bureaucratic.

We do have a few point people that can answer and address general, or non-location specific PyLadies questions.  If you are not a local PyLadies leader, you may do so via our `general email`_.  If you are a local PyLadies leader, you may email our `organizers list`_ (must be added to the `mailing list`_ first).

Mailing List
------------

We have a `global mailing list`_ in which anyone can join. Be sure to fill out the one request:

| To be approved, please give a 1-5 sentence bio about yourself, how you heard about PyLadies, and/or how you use Python.
|

The mailing list is subject to the PyLadies :doc:`../difficult/coc`.

Newsletter
----------

The Pyladies global newsletter is sent out as regularly as we can make it; all work is voluntary, and all information is volunteered! Everyone who subscribes via the email form on  http://www.pyladies.com will receive the newsletter.


Contributing
++++++++++++
The editor of an upcoming issue of the PyLadies global newsletter might make an effort to gather info about all the local groups via a message to the organizers mailing list, but the onus is on each group's organizer(s) to send any updates about a group to the editor if they want to be included.


Editing
+++++++

If you'd like to volunteer to edit the next issue, all you have to do is shoot an email to the organizers mailing list! Warning: it's a lot of work!  We use Mailchimp.
