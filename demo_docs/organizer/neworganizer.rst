New Organizer Reference
=======================


Email & Google Apps
-------------------

All PyLadies locations will have their own general email address (e.g. ``nyc@pyladies.com``).  You and your other co-organizers can manage that email address how you'd like (e.g. all co-organizers can log in; all email is forwarded; only one organizer manages it; etc).

The ``@pyladies.com`` email account management is setup with Google Apps. Therefore, every ``@pyladies.com`` address also has Google Drive.  We **highly** encourage you to use Google Drive for form collection of any sort, document management, etc.

You can also leverage the Google Apps account with your own local Google+ Community/Profile page, Google Contacts & Calendar, and the like.

It is also good practice to keep personal and PyLadies communications separate.  You can easily do this if you use the Chrome browser and setup `two separate profiles`_ - one for personal and one for PyLadies.

Account & Password Management
-----------------------------

Please sign up for all accounts related to your PyLadies location with the ``@pyladies.com`` email address.  This is so that handover to a future organizer is a lot smoother, and account recovery is easier.


We highly suggest you use a unique password for each account you use for your PyLadies location.  `LastPass`_ is a password manager (so you don't have to remember every unique password) that allows you to create unique and difficult-to-guess passwords, as well as save them for you.

`LastPass`_ also allows you to `share`_ passwords with folks; so you can setup your local PyLadies Facebook account, then store that password in `LastPass`_, and allow your co-organizers to log in with that stored password by sharing it.

Social Media
------------

You are free and encouraged to use any social media that you'd like (be sure to register the account with your ``@pyladies.com`` email address! See :ref:`acctmgmt`).

Be sure to fill out the `PyLadies Resource Form`_ for data collection so we can be aware of your local "footprint" - both for PSF trademark reasons (to know if the use of the PyLadies name is legitimate) and for account recovery/handover process.

Logo Use & Adaptation
---------------------

You may of course use the PyLadies Wordmark and PyLadies Geek logos for promotion, and/or alter them to adapt to your location.  Check out our locations_ page for inspiration.

Please read our :doc:`../misc/trademark`, especially if you plan on using the logos to print merchandise for sale.
