Joining PyLadies
----------------

Want to join PyLadies? Fantastic!  But I hate to break it to you, you already are one ;-).

Finding your local PyLadies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We (try to) maintain a list of PyLadies `locations`_, but it may not be complete or up-to-date as every location is reponsible for updating & maintaining their location's information.

.. note::

    If you believe that there is a location not shown on our `locations`_ page, please feel free to ping the organizer (if you know them), `file an issue`_ or `submit a pull request`_ with the relevant information!

Once you find your location, go ahead and join their Meetup.com group (if they have one), and join/follow any social media accounts they have.


Remote PyLadies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can't be everywhere.  But we're trying!  For those who do not have a PyLadies group within a reasonable distance (or even if you do!) we have an online PyLadies group called `Remote PyLadies`_!  Events are held by local organizers through online streaming/coding/etc tools and posted on the `Remote PyLadies`_ site.


Want to volunteer?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often times, our organizers - both local & remote - need help.  Whether it's mentorship for events, logistic help (e.g. a door woman).  Don't be shy in reaching out to them!  Their contact information *should* be listed on our `locations`_ page.  But if you're having trouble, please feel free to `ping us`_ for introductions.


Difficult Stuff
---------------

While we all strive to be awesome, sh*t happens.  Please have a read of the following resources:
